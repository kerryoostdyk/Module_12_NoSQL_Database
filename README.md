In this module, I worked with a raw JSON file to create and manage a NoSQL database using MongoDB. The tasks I completed include:

Importing the JSON data into MongoDB.
Transforming the data to ensure its structure met the requirements of the analysis.
Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract insights from the database.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with NoSQL databases, handle data transformations, and analyze data efficiently.
